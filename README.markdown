# Publish/Edit Screen Quick Fixes #

This is a small set of fixes for persistent annoyances with the EE CP, and specifically with the Publish/Edit screens (and to a lesser extent the File Manager screens.)

Currently, it does the following:

* Adds Month/Year dropdowns to all datepickers
* Hides (but does *not* remove from DOM) dropdowns for "Fixed/Localized" setting on all custom date fields
